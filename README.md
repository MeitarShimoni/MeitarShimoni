Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Meitar Shimoni
ðŸŽ“ 4th-year Electronics Engineering Student at Ariel University
ðŸ”§ Passionate about signal processing, digital electronics, problem-solving, and creating impactful projects.
ðŸ’¡ I love diving deep into digital systems, logic design, microelectronics, and signal processing, bringing theoretical knowledge into practical applications.

About Me
Iâ€™m an enthusiastic engineering student with hands-on experience in digital logic design, C++ programming, and circuit simulation. Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve worked on projects that blend creativity with technical skills, including designing a digital control system for a DC motor, which challenged me to problem-solve in real-time and collaborate effectively with a teammate.

Skills
Programming: C++
Digital Logic Design: Experience in designing and simulating circuits with tools like NI Multisim
Circuit Simulation: MATLAB, PSPICE
Signal Processing: Knowledge and practical experience from coursework and projects
Testing & Hardware Platforms: Oscilloscopes, Arduino, ESP32
Soft Skills: Teamwork, adaptability, and a strong desire for continuous learning and self-improvement

What Iâ€™m Working On
Iâ€™m currently focused on expanding my knowledge in areas like ASIC/FPGA design, system-on-chip (SoC) projects, real-time processing, and enhancing my skills in signal processing.

Letâ€™s Connect!
Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects and learn from others in the field. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to work together or chat about electronics, digital design, or new technologies!
